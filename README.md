# User List Management System - Frontend

## Introduction
This application was developed during an internship at "Intransition". It represents the frontend part of the User List Management System, built using React. It's uniquely designed for handling user data, including authentication, registration, and managing a user list. A key feature allows users to select the number of errors in the generated user data, triggering the application to re-render accordingly. This functionality is ideal for testing and data analysis scenarios.
